# Team Agreement

## Cooperation Plan
## Strengths?
- Jeffrey Smith: My strength is knowledge, organization, creative the flow of things.
- Miguel’s strength within this program is CSS and HTML. With the ability to learn new stuff, work as a team, and plan effectively.
- Jackson is good at Javascript and referencing css element paths.
- David's strengths are structured html layout/ grid. Decent understanding with github and version control
How can you best utilize these strengths in the execution of your project? We can use our strengths to equally divide the load.
What professional competencies do you wish to develop?
- Jackson: I wish to develop my growth mindset some more, and also improve my professional quality.
- David wishes to work on his communication competency, especially in the speaking Competency.
- Miguel: I really want to work on the ability to increase my quality of work. To be able to remember the syntax and purpose behind some syntax.
Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?
- We are going to look into using Trello, creating to-do lists to divide up the work, and setting expectations for the task on hand. We’ll use github to manage our projects.

## Conflict Plan

What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?
- Our plan is to be open to criticism, and have an open mindset. If goals aren’t being met or If we have creative differences or approach / find different solutions, we’ll voice our concerns.
What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?
- If someone is taking over the project, tell them to take a break. Encourage others to take on tasks that are within their skill level and spread out the workload. So that we are all growing and practicing our skills that we have learned in class.
How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
- We are going to use patience and empathy for classmates who aren’t at the same level with certain skills, it’s a class, not a company so we have the expectations that some people may not learn as quickly as others. Have the more advanced developer save some of the more lower level tasks for less experienced developers.
How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?
- If someone isn’t pulling their weight, be honest, and help them out or set a plan on how they can work on the project. We have all come to the conclusion that we take criticism well and we will use the critique to further develop our skills.
How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?
- After 2 or 3 attempts of trying to resolve the conflict we have agreed to take the current issue with management. It is not wise to keep on beating on a dead horse and figure out a solution with a teacher.
Communication Plan
What hours is everyone free?
- We’re expecting 9-6 on weekdays to complete our project, if we do not meet our target goal by the end of wednesday or are far away from reaching it, we will consider working past 6pm on the weekdays.
Platforms to communicate. 
-We created a discord channel to reach each other on as well as using slack to reach one another if they aren’t active on discord or vice versa.
Break expectations?
- We are allowing all of our team mates to take breaks as needed. We would rather have a good performing team rather than a team asking for permission.
What is your plan if you fall behind?
- We honestly do not expect to fall behind with reaching our main goal before friday of next week, but we will be willing to stay late on days when we are available to ensure completion.
After hour communication?
- Throw it on a discord, but don’t expect an immediate response. We wish to be able to complete this project in its entirety but we know that people have lives outside of school. However we will do our best to respond to our teammates' questions or concerns.
Make sure everyone's voice is heard?
- Stay open and respect each other ! No matter how miniscule or weird the question might seem we raise our voice to finish the project.
How to create a good environment?
- Not interrupting or speaking over each other. Let people speak their mind. No toxic behaviors.
# Work Plan
What's the work plan going to look like ?
- We are going to first create an outline/ wireframe of the what our web pages should look like,
What type of functions and constructors we will need, then with than information and what elements they they should be inside, where to store our media for our project.
We will create a trello to outline the dev process. ??? Start filling out trello tabs and hitting goals and marking as complete on Trello.
What work management tools?
Trello, google slides, slack are all tools we are looking to use to get our website done in a quick manner.

Git Process
What parts of your project will be on github.
- The webpage, or file storage and file merging is what we will be using github for. We are using third party software to ensure project goal completion as well as tracking bugs and known issues.
Git ownership? 
- We are using an Organization. 
Git Flow?
- Separate branch for every feature, have at least two confirms before we merge.
Git pull request process?
- Three people will review the request, the one who pushed it and another. Anyone can merge after it has been reviewed. After the goal for that branch is met, you can push to branch, just don’t merge.
We will tell eachother what we will be doing.
